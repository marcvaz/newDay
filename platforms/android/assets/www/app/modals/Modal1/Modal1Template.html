            1. I've wasted so much time, I should have started this earlier.
    </p>



    <p   >
            
            2. There's not enough time to complete this task and do it well so there's no point starting.
    </p>



    <p   >
            
            3. I don't know where to start, there's so much to be done.
    </p>



    <p   >
            
            4. This task is so important, I can't afford to not do it perfectly.
    </p>



    <p   >
            
            5. I don't feel like starting this task right now, I'll feel more like doing it later today/tomorrow.
    </p>



    <p   >
            
            6. There's enough time left I can start it later.
    </p>



    <p   >
            
            7. The task scares me, I don't  know if I have the skills to do it well.
    </p>



    <p   >
            
            8. I think I won't do well because I've failed at this task before.
    </p>



    <p   >
            
            9. I'm just not good at this task, there's no point trying.
