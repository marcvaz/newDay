            1. I've wasted so much time, I should have started this earlier.

<div class="col" >


    <p   >
            
            What happened in the past is in the past, and shouldn't poison my present. I still have control of what I do now and give it my best.

            2. There's not enough time to complete this task and do it well so there's no point starting.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="col" >


    <p   >
            
            I can still try hard and starting now means I'll definitely do better than if I don't start.

            3. I don't know where to start, there's so much to be done.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="col" >


    <p   >
            
            There's no "right" place to start, the best thing I can do is just start somewhere.

            4. This task is very important and I can't afford to do badly at it which stresses me out.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="col" >


    <p   >
            
            I actually can't guarantee  the outcome of this task anyway. I can only give my best at this point in time and hope that it turns out well.

            5. I don't feel like starting this task right now, I'll feel more like doing it later today/tomorrow.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="col" >


    <p   >
            
            If I'm honest with myself I know tomorrow will likely be no different than today. If I want to get this task done, the only option is to start it right now.

            6. There's enough time left I can start it later.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="col" >


    <p   >
            
            There have been many times when I've underestimated how long tasks take, it's better to start it now and not take a risk.

            7. The task scares me, I don't  know if I have the skills to do it well.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="col" >


    <p   >
            
            It's definitely possible that my skills are not where I want them to be, and that's ok, all I can do now is give it my best.

            8. I think I won't do well because I've failed at this task before.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="col" >


    <p   >
            
            Just because something happened in the past does not mean that it will happen the same way again.

            9. I'm just not good at this task, there's no point trying.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="col" >


    <p   >
            
            I'm not good at this task right now, but that just means I have the opportunity to grow and become better.
